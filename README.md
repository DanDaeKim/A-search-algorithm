# A-search-algorithm
In this example, we have defined a simple Graph class with methods to add edges and store their weights. The heuristic_cost_estimate function is used to estimate the cost from a given node to the goal. The a_star_search function takes a graph, a start node, and a goal node as input and returns the shortest path between them using the A* algorithm. The example usage section demonstrates how to create a graph, add edges, and find the shortest path between two nodes.
